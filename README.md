The goal of the project is to understand the marketplace of the United States for the year 2014-2016, through visualization. 
The input data  are extracted from the US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace).
The coding language is Python and more specifically I use the data framework Apache Spark, due to the capabilities of the ELT.
Each subset of data that is generated, is saved in the NoSQL database Apache Cassandra.
